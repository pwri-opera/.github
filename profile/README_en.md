# Introduction
prwi-opera is a GitHub organization for open source project management of the autonomous construction technology platform "OPERA".
OPERA is an open platform that anyone can use to develope automous construction system.
Here we publish a basic software based on the simulator and ROS, which are part of OPERA.

One of the purposes to public OPERA is to increase the number of collaborators in the development of technologies to advance autonomous construction for the future of the civil engineering and construction industry, where the workforce is declining at an accelerating rate.
Another objective is to ensure the reusability and portability of development deliverables and to create a cycle of continuous improvement.

For those who support and agree with these objectives of OPERA, we expect the following responses.
* Comments, opinions, and requests for improvement about OPERA.  
* Issues and pull requests of OPERA's software
* If possile, Publishing your results on paper or Github

In addition, Pulic Works Research Institute(PWRI) has adopted the following operation policy for the dissemination of information through pwri-opera.
